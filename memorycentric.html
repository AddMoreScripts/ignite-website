                    <p>
                        Apache Ignite is based on <i>memory-centric architecture</i> that combines the performance and scale of
                        in-memory computing together with the disk durability and strong consistency in one system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main difference between the memory-centric approach and the traditional disk-centric approach is that
                        the memory is treated as a fully functional storage, not just as a caching layer, like most databases do.
                        For example, Apache Ignite can function in a pure in-memory mode, in which case it can be treated as an
                        In-Memory Database (IMDB) and In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) in one.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12" style="padding-right:0">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/memory-centric.png" width="440px" style="float: right; margin-top: -25px;"/>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                On the other hand, when persistence is turned on, Ignite begins to function as a memory-centric system
                where most of the processing happens in memory, but the data and indexes get persisted to disk. The main
                difference here from the traditional disk-centric RDBMS or NoSQL system is that Ignite is strongly consistent,
                horizontally scalable, and supports both SQL and key-value processing APIs.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h2>Collocated vs Client-Server Processing</h2>
            <p>
                The disk-centric systems, like RDBMS or NoSQL, generally utilize the classic client-server approach, where
                the data is brought from the server to the client side where it gets processed and then is usually discarded.
                This approach does not scale well as moving the data over the network is the most expensive operation in a distributed system.
            </p>
            <p>
                A much more scalable approach is <b>collocated processing</b> that reverses the flow by bringing the computations to the
                servers where the data actually resides. This approach allows you to execute advanced logic or distributed SQL with JOINs
                exactly where the data is stored avoiding expensive serialization and network trips.
