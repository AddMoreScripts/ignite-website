                <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12" style="padding-left:0; padding-right:0;">
                    <p>
                        Even though Apache Ignite is broadly used as a caching layer on top of external databases, it
                        comes with its native persistence that is a distributed, ACID, and SQL-compliant disk-based
                        store.
                        The native persistence integrates into the Ignite memory-centric storage as a disk tier that can
                        be turned on to let Ignite store more data on disk than it can cache in memory and to enable
                        fast cluster restarts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With native persistence enabled, Ignite always stores a superset of data on disk, and caches as
                        much as
                        it can in memory. For example, if your application stores 200 records in an Ignite cluster and
                        your
                        memory capacity allows caching only 150 of them, then those 150 records will be served from
                        memory while
                        the rest 50 from disk whenever the application requests them.

            <div class="page-heading">Ignite Persistence vs. External Databases</div>
            <p>
                The native persistence has the following advantages over external databases that can also be used as
                the disk tier in Ignite:
            </p>
            <ul class="page-list" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <li>
                    An ability to cache a subset of the data - the native persistence always stores 100% of data on
                    disk and lets you cache as much as required in memory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An ability to query data from disk - if any record is missing in memory, then Ignite takes it from
                    disk. This is supported for all the APIs including SQL.
                </li>
                <li>
                <li>
                    Instantaneous cluster restarts - Ignite becomes fully operational from disk upon a cluster
                    startup or restarts without requiring to preload or warm up the memory tier.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="page-heading">Write-Ahead Logging and Checkpointing</div>
            <p>
                If Ignite native persistence is selected as a disk tier, then every time a record is updated in memory,
                the change is added to the write-ahead log (WAL). The purpose of the WAL is to propagate updates to disk
                in the fastest way possible and provide a consistent recovery mechanism that supports full cluster
                failures.

                As WAL grows, it periodically gets checkpointed to the main storage. Checkpointing is the process of
                copying dirty pages from the memory tier to the partition files on disk. A dirty page is a page that was
                updated in memory, was appended to WAL, but was not written to a respective partition file on disk yet.
            </p>

            <div class="page-heading">Durability</div>
            <p>
                Ignite provides strong ACID durability guarantees to the data:
            </p>

            <ul class="page-list" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <li>
                    Committed transactions always survive failures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The cluster can always be recovered to the latest successfully committed transaction.
                </li>
            </ul>
