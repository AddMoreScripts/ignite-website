                        Apache Ignite is based on distributed <i>memory-centric architecture</i> that combines the
                        performance and scale of in-memory computing together with the disk durability and strong
                        consistency in one system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main difference between the memory-centric approach and the traditional disk-centric approach is that
                        the memory is treated as a fully functional storage, not just as a caching layer, like most databases do.
                        For example, Apache Ignite can function in a pure in-memory mode, in which case it can be treated as an
                        In-Memory Database (IMDB) and In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) in one.
                    </p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                On the other hand, when persistence is turned on, Ignite begins to function as a memory-centric system
                where most of the processing happens in memory on cached data, but the superset of data and indexes get persisted to disk.

                            performance possible because the data is never written to disk. To prevent possible data
                            loss when a single cluster node fails, it is recommended to configure a number of backup
                            copies (aka. replication factor) appropriately.

                Ignite Persistence is the most flexible, scalable, and convenient way of persisting data in Ignite.
                It is widely used in scenarios where applications need a distributed memory-centric database.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ignite native persistence is a distributed, ACID, and <nobr>SQL-compliant</nobr> disk store
                that transparently integrates with Ignite's memory-centric storage. Ignite persistence is optional
                and can be turned on and off. When turned off Ignite becomes a pure in-memory store.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following are the advantages and characteristics of Apache Ignite when Ignite native persistence is used
                together with Ignite in-memory store:

            <p>
                Ignite can be used as a caching layer (aka. data grid) above an existing 3rd party
                database - RDBMS, NoSQL, or HDFS. This mode is used to accelerate the underlying database that persists
                the data. Ignite stores data in memory, distributed across multiple nodes providing fast data access.
                It reduces the network overhead caused due to frequent data movement between an application and the database.
                However, there are some limitations in comparison to the native persistence. For instance, SQL queries
                will be executed only on the data that is in RAM, thus, requiring to preload all the data set from disk
                to memory beforehand.

            </h2>
            <p>
                If you do not want to use Ignite native persistence or 3rd party persistence, you can enable swapping,
                in which case, Ignite in-memory data will be moved to the swap space located on disk if you run out of RAM.
                When swap space is enabled, Ignites stores data in memory mapped files (MMF) whose content will be
                swapped to disk by the OS depending on the current RAM consumption. The swap space is mostly used to
                avoid out of memory errors (OOME) that might happen if RAM consumption goes beyond its capacity and
                you need more time to scale the cluster out to​ redistribute the data sets evenly.

            </h2>
            <p>
                The disk-centric systems, like RDBMS or NoSQL, generally utilize the classic client-server approach, where
                the data is brought from the server to the client side where it gets processed and then is usually discarded.
                This approach does not scale well as moving the data over the network is the most expensive operation in a distributed system.
            </p>
            <p>
                A much more scalable approach is <b>collocated processing</b> that reverses the flow by bringing the computations to the
                servers where the data actually resides. This approach allows you to execute advanced logic or distributed SQL with JOINs
                exactly where the data is stored avoiding expensive serialization and network trips.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Depending on the configuration, Ignite can either partition or replicate data across its memory-centric
                storage. Unlike <code>REPLICATED</code> mode, where data is fully replicated across all nodes
                in the cluster, in <code>PARTITIONED</code> mode Ignite will equally split the data across
                multiple cluster nodes, allowing for staring TBs of data both in memory and on disk.

                            that transparently integrates with Ignite memory-centric storage:

                            Depending on the configuration, Ignite can either <i>partition</i> or <i>replicate</i>
                            data. Unlike <code>REPLICATED</code> mode, where data is fully replicated across
                            all nodes in the cluster, in <code>PARTITIONED</code> mode Ignite will equally split the data
                            across multiple cluster nodes.

                            Ignite can act as a data grid that is a distributed, transactional key-value store. Unlike
                            other in-memory data grids (IMDG), Ignite enables storing data both, in memory and on disk,
                            and therefore is able to store more data than can fit in physical memory:

                            Ignite is used as a caching layer (aka. data grid) above 3rd party databases such as RDBMS,
                            Apache Cassandra, MongoDB:
