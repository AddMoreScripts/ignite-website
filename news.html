                            The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350
                            Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache™ Ignite™ has graduated from the Apache Incubator
                            to become a Top-Level Project (TLP), signifying that the project's community and products have been well-governed
                            under the ASF's meritocratic process and principles.</br></br>

                            Imagine a bank offering variety of services to its customers. The customers of the bank are
                            located in different geo-zones (regions), and most of the operations performed by a customer are zone-local,
                            like ATM withdrawals or bill payments... However, some operations, such as wire transfers for example,
                            may affect customers across different zones. Cross-zone operations are not as frequent, but nevertheless
                            need to be supported in a transactional fashion as well.</br></br>

                            In my previous post I have demonstrated benchmarks for atomic JCache (JSR 107)
                            operations and optimistic transactions between Apache Ignite data grid and Hazelcast.
                            In this blog I will focus on benchmarking the pessimistic transactions.</br></br>

                            Recently I have been doing many benchmarks comparing the Apache
                            Ignite project to other products. In this blog I will describe my experience in comparing
                            basic cache operations for Apache Ignite Data Grid vs Hazelcast Data Grid.</br></br>
