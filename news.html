                        Imagine a bank offering variety of services to its customers. The customers of the bank are
                        located in different geo-zones (regions), and most of the operations performed by a customer are zone-local,
                        like ATM withdrawals or bill payments... However, some operations, such as wire transfers for example,
                        may affect customers across different zones. Cross-zone operations are not as frequent, but nevertheless
                        need to be supported in a transactional fashion as well.</br></br>
