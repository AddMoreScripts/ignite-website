                        If you ever looked at Apache Ignite, you have probably noticed that it is a fairly rich platform with lots of components.
                        However, despite the extensive feature set, Ignite community aims to make the platform easy to use and understand.
                        In this blog, author Dmitriy Setrakyan defines Ignite by answering several "<i>Is Ignite a ...?</i>" questions.

                        In many organizations, different departments and teams work with different programming languages and frameworks. However, there may be a need for a
                        common storage format to allow various tools to access the same data. Apache Ignite provides the flexibility for development teams to continue working with
                        their favorite programming languages and tools and have the ability to work with the same data in the cluster.

                        Starting with 2.1 release, Apache Ignite has become one of a very few in-memory computing systems that provides its own distributed
                        persistence layer. Essentially, users do not have to integrate Ignite with any type of 3rd party databases (although such integration is still supported),
                        and start using Ignite as a primary storage of their data on disk and in memory. So, what makes Ignite data storage unique?

                    <p>
                        The power and beauty of in-memory computing projects is that they truly do what they state -- deliver outstanding performance
                        improvements by moving data closer to the CPU, using RAM as a storage and spreading the data sets out across a cluster of machines relying on horizontal scalability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there is an unspoken side of the story. No matter how fast a platform is, we do not want to lose the data and encounter cluster restarts or other outages. To guarantee this we need to somehow make data persistent on the disk.

                        A major use case for the Service Grid is to deploy a Singleton. There are a number of different types of Singletons that Apache Ignite supports but two common types are — Node Singleton and Cluster Singleton.

                        In Apache Ignite, a data grid can be thought of as a distributed Key-Value (K-V) store or a distributed HashMap. Learn more about it in this article.

                        With its latest release, Apache Ignite 2.0 introduced support for DDL, a redesigned off-heap memory architecture, distributed algebra, Spring data integration,
                        support for Hibernate 5, Rocket MQ Integration, as well as plenty of improvements to the currently existing Apache Ignite feature set to enhance speed and performance.
                        Another key feature rolled in is multi-cluster support for Apache Ignite Web Console, which means you can monitor and manage multiple Ignite clusters in parallel
                        from a single instance of Ignite Web console deployed on your system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This tutorial shows how to start two separate clusters on your system and connect it to an instance of Ignite Web Console deployed locally.

                        Recently Apache Ignite 2.0 introduced a beta version of the in-memory machine learning grid, which is a distributed machine learning library built on top of the Apache IMDG.
                        This beta release of ML library can perform local and distributed vector, decompositions and matrix algebra operations.
                        The data structure can be stored in Java heap, off-heap or distributed Ignite caches. In this short post, we are going to download the new Apache Ignite 2.0 release, build the example and run them.

                        This major release was under the development for a long time. The community spent almost a year incorporating tremendous changes to the legacy Apache Ignite 1.x architecture.
                        Curious why are we so boastful about this? Some of the main features of Apache Ignite 2.0 are:

                        All applications fundamentally are comprised of computing instructions and data the instructions utilize to solve a problem.
                        These applications are high performant when computing instructions and data  are  distributed among available computing resources.
                        A ‘<b>cloud ready</b>’ application should be able to:
                        <ul class="page-list">
                            <li>Massively parallelize compute instructions.</li>

                        Over time as business requirements evolve and Cassandra deployments scale, many organizations find themselves
                        constrained by some of Cassandra’s limitations, which in turn restrict what they can do with their data.
                        Apache Ignite, an in-memory computing platform, provides these organizations with a new way to access and manage their Cassandra infrastructure,
                        allowing them to make Cassandra data available to new OLTP and OLAP use cases while delivering extremely high performance.

                        My best definition of Apache Ignite is that it's a distributed in-memory cache, query and compute engine built to work with
                        large-scale data sets in real-time. A cluster of Ignite nodes (which is simply a combination of server and client nodes) will slide between the application and data layers.

                    <p>
                        Apache Ignite has the concept of Data Streamers: components to ingest fast data in a
                        streaming fashion into an Ignite cache from a variety of protocols, technologies or
                        platforms, such as JMS, MQTT, Twitter, Flume, Kafka, etc. However, with Apache Ignite 1.5.0
                        we released the jack of all trades: an Apache Camel streamer.

                    <p>
                        For systems where low latency is critical, there is nothing better than caching the data in memory in a distributed cluster.
                        While storing data in memory provides fast data access, distributing it on a cluster of nodes
                        increases application performance and scalability. And Apache Ignite helps you achieve exactly that.

                        Imagine a bank offering variety of services to its customers. The customers of the bank are
                        located in different geo-zones (regions), and most of the operations performed by a customer are zone-local,
                        like ATM withdrawals or bill payments... However, some operations, such as wire transfers for example,
                        may affect customers across different zones. Cross-zone operations are not as frequent, but nevertheless
                        need to be supported in a transactional fashion as well.
