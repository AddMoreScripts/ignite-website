                    <p> This is the last blog post in a series recommending how to design and implement microservices-based architecture on top of Apache Ignite In-Memory Data Fabric. The first two posts in the series can be found here:</p>
                    <ul class="page-list">
                        <li><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/running-microservices-on-top-of-in-memory-data-gri" target="_blank">Part I</a> - Overview of the proposed solution.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/running-microservices-on-top-of-in-memory-data-gri-1" target="_blank">Part II</a> - Various coding templates needed to implement the solution in a live environment.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This final post describes how to integrate the cluster with a persistent store and send requests to the microservices from external applications -- apps that know nothing about the cluster and don't rely on its APIs.

                        Ignite.NET offers a LINQ provider which translates C# expressions to SQL queries. LINQ has many benefits over SQL — but at what cost? Read on to find out.

                        My best definition of Apache Ignite is that it's a distributed in-memory cache, query and compute engine built to work with
                        large-scale data sets in real-time. A cluster of Ignite nodes (which is simply a combination of server and client nodes) will slide between the application and data layers.

                        Apache Ignite has the concept of Data Streamers: components to ingest fast data in a
                        streaming fashion into an Ignite cache from a variety of protocols, technologies or
                        platforms, such as JMS, MQTT, Twitter, Flume, Kafka, etc. However, with Apache Ignite 1.5.0
                        we released the jack of all trades: an Apache Camel streamer.

                    <p>
                        For systems where low latency is critical, there is nothing better than caching the data in memory in a distributed cluster.
                        While storing data in memory provides fast data access, distributing it on a cluster of nodes
                        increases application performance and scalability. And Apache Ignite helps you achieve exactly that.

                        Imagine a bank offering variety of services to its customers. The customers of the bank are
                        located in different geo-zones (regions), and most of the operations performed by a customer are zone-local,
                        like ATM withdrawals or bill payments... However, some operations, such as wire transfers for example,
                        may affect customers across different zones. Cross-zone operations are not as frequent, but nevertheless
                        need to be supported in a transactional fashion as well.
