        <p>
            Apache Ignite can be used as an in-memory data grid that accelerates and scales your existing databases and
            data stores. The grid supports key-value and ANSI SQL APIs, ACID transactions, co-located processing,
            and machine learning libraries. As an in-memory data grid, Ignite is frequently used to increase the
            performance and scalability of real-time applications, to support <a href="/use-cases/high-performance-computing.html">
            high-performance computing</a>, and to cache data that is scattered across databases.

        <h2>What is an In-Memory Data Grid?</h2>

        <p>
            An in-memory data grid is an advanced read-through/write-through cache that is deployed on top of multiple databases.
            The grid supports various APIs, such as SQL, compute, and key-value. Applications write to and read from the
            grid, and the grid propagates changes to the underlying data stores in a consistent way.
        </p>
        <p>
            With Ignite, your applications can utilize multiple APIs for data processing. Key-value and SQL queries
            enable you to request, join, and group distributed datasets. Compute and machine-learning APIs execute
            logic close to the data, thus eliminating expensive data shuffling over the network.
        </p>

        <h2>IGNITE AS AN IN-MEMORY DATA GRID AND EXTERNAL DATABASES</h2>

        <p>
            Ignite can improve the performance and scalability of most external databases and data stores (such as RDBMS,
            NoSQL, and  Hadoop) by sliding in as an in-memory data grid between the application and the database layers.
            When the application writes data to the cache, Ignite writes-through or writes-behind all data modifications
            to the underlying external store. Ignite also performs ACID transactions (coordinating and committing transactions
            across both the cluster and the database).
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, Ignite can be deployed as a shared and unified in-memory layer that stores datasets that originate
            from disjointed databases. Your applications can consume all the data from Ignite as a single store while Ignite
            synchronizes the original databases whenever in-memory data is updated.
        </p>

        <h2>IGNITE NATIVE PERSISTENCE</h2>

        <p>
            Ignite Native Persistence is a distributed ACID-compliant, SQL-compliant disk store that transparently
            integrates with the Ignite in-memory layer. When Native Persistence is enabled, Ignite stores both
            data and indexes on disk, thus eliminating the time-consuming cache warm-up step. Native Persistence
            keeps a full copy of data on disk, so you are free to cache a subset of records in memory. If a required
            data record is missing from memory, Ignite reads the record from the disk automatically, regardless of the
            API (whether SQL, key-value, or scan queries).
        </p>
