                        High-performance computing (HPC) is the ability to process data and perform complex
                        calculations at high speeds. Apache Ignite enables HPC by providing APIs for compute- and
                        data-intensive calculations. The APIs implement the MapReduce paradigm and let you run
                        arbitrary tasks across the cluster of Ignite nodes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having Ignite as a high-performance compute cluster, you can turn a group of commodity
                        machines or a cloud environment into a distributed supercomputer of interconnected Ignite
                        nodes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ignite enables speed and scale for HPC scenarios by processing records in memory with the
                        elimination of data shuffling and network utilization.

            <div class="page-heading">Co-located Processing</div>
            <p>
                Ignite uses the notion of co-located processing to guide HPC workloads implementations in distributed
                in-memory environments. The primary aim of this type of processing is to increase the performance of
                your complex calculations by running them straight on the Ignite cluster nodes. In such a case, the
                calculations process only local data sets of the cluster nodes, thus, avoiding records shuffling over
                the network. It results in minimal network utilization, and an order of magnitude performance increase
                depending on the data volume.
            </p>

            <p>
                To exploit the co-located processing in practice, first, you need to co-locate data by storing related
                records on the same cluster node. Consider your bank account and transactions posted to it as an example
                of related or co-located data. Once you set <code>accountID</code> as an affinity
                key for <code>Transactions</code> table, then you'll instruct Ignite to store all the transactions with
                the same <code>accountId</code> on a single cluster node that keeps the record of your account in
                <code>Accounts</code> table.
            </p>

            <p>
                As soon as data is co-located, Ignite can execute compute- and data-intensive logic on the cluster nodes
                that store the records required for the calculation. For instance, a payment processing system can send
                a compute task for previous transactions verification to a specific Ignite node that stores your account
                record with all completed transactions and finish fraud-detection verifications locally on that machine.
                Thus, instead of pulling all the transactions back to the application over the network, the processing
                system eliminates network utilization by running verifications on the nodes that store actual data.
                The effect is even more significant when the system needs to process millions of transactions per second,
                verifying billions of previously completed payments.
            </p>

            <div class="page-heading">Compute APIs</div>

            <p>
                Ignite provides compute APIs (also known as compute grid in Ignite) for creation and scheduling custom
                tasks of arbitrary complexity. The APIs implement MapReduce paradigm and presently available for Java,
                C# and C++ programming languages.
