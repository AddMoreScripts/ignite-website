            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-xs-12" style="padding:0 0 10px 0;">
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12" style="padding-left:0; padding-right:0">
                    <p>
                        A digital integration hub (DIH) is an advanced platform architecture that aggregates
                        multiple back-end systems and databases into a low-latency and shared data store. Apache
                        Ignite can function as this high-performance shared store by caching and persisting data sets
                        dispersed across many disjointed external databases and systems.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Applications typically access Ignite via an API services layer and get substantial
                        performance growth by requesting data from this only distributed store that, in its turn,
                        keeps all the records in memory and offloads the back-end systems.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12" style="padding-right:0">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/digital-hub.png" width="440px"
                         style="float:right;"/>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                The primary purpose of Ignite as of a DIH component is to enable implementations of large-scale and
                high-throughput architectures that prevent the back-end systems from being overwhelmed with excessive
                workloads and to avoid complex integrations between the back-end databases and front-end API services.
            </p>

            <div class="page-heading">Synchronization of Apache Ignite and Back-End Systems</div>
            <p>
                Ignite, as the high-performance data store, needs to be synchronized with the back-end databases via
                streaming, event-based, change data capture (CDC), or other techniques.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ignite provides a <code>CacheStore</code> interface for one-way synchronization between an Ignite
                cluster and an external store supporting relational databases and some NoSQL stores out-of-the-box.
                The interface allows Ignite to write-through or write-behind all the changes to the backend-systems
                automatically. It also includes transactions - Ignite coordinates and commits a transaction across its
                in-memory cluster as well as an external transactional database.
            </p>

            <p>
                For bi-directional synchronization, you can consider various streaming, CDC, and event-based
                technologies. For instance, Kafka, Spark, Debezium are widely used to keep Ignite in sync with other
                databases.
            </p>

            <div class="page-heading">Real-Time Analytics</div>

            <p>
                Although real-time analytics is not a defining characteristic of digital integration hub architectures,
                in some situations, you can end up consolidating operational and analytical data silos in Apache Ignite.
                If this happens, you can tap into Ignite SQL, compute and machine learning capabilities for real-time
                analytics needs.
            </p>
