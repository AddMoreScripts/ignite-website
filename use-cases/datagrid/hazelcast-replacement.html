            <p>
                Both, Apache Ignite and Hazelcast provide a feature rich data grid functionality responsible for
                partitioning and caching data in memory with the capability to scale out across distributed clusters.
                However, by switching from Hazelcast to Apache Ignite, developers can leverage all the additional features
                that Ignite provides as compared to Hazelcast.

                        Both, Apache Ignite and Hazelcast implement JCache specification (JSR 107), so it should be
                        a relatively easy process to switch from Hazelcast to Apache Ignite and take benefit of
                        the additional functionality available in Ignite.

                    <td><p>
                        While <em>on-heap</em> memory is certainly the most natural way to cache data,
                        JVM does not work well with large heap sizes (more than 16GB), causing lengthy GC pauses.
                        Hazelcast does provide developers with a limited option to store the data <em>off-heap</em>,
                        however indexes still remain <em>on-heap</em>. Given that indexes usually require about 30% of additional space,
                        this can still lead to large GC pauses, which defeats the very reason to store the data <em>off-heap</em>
                        to begin with. Apache Ignite, on the other hand, is able to store both, the cached data and the indexes
                        in the <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/off-heap-memory"><em>off-heap</em></a> memory,
                        allowing to completely eliminate any GC overhead within user applications.

                    <td><p>
                        Hazelcast has limited support for SQL queries and absolutely no support for JOINs, even when using their predicate-based API. Apache Ignite, on the other hand,
                        supports free-form <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/cache-queries">SQL queries</a> virtually without any limitations (ANSI 99 compliant). You can use any
                        SQL function, any aggregation, any grouping and Ignite will figure out where to fetch the results from.
                        Ignite also supports distributed <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/cache-queries#section-sql-joins">SQL JOINs</a>. Moreover, if the data resides in different caches,
                        Ignite allows for cross-cache JOIN queries as well.

                    <td><p>
                        Both, Apache Ignite and Hazelcast support <em>partitioned</em> as well as <em>replicated</em> caches.
                        However, Hazelcast does not recommend using replicated caches due to its inability to keep data consistent on all nodes.
                        Moreover, Hazelcast recommends storing only immutable objects when using a replicated cache, to avoid reading any stale data.
                        In contrast, Apache Ignite guarantees full data consistency across all the nodes in the cluster,
                        regardless of any data type, and any <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/cache-modes">cache distribution mode</a> configured.

                        where data can be stored and moved between <em>on-heap</em>, <em>off-heap</em>, and <em>swap</em> space. Going up the tier
                        provides more data storage capacity, with gradual increase in latency.

            <h3>Transactional Put and Get Benchmark</h3><br/>

            <p>
                Benchmarks transactional distributed cache put and get operations together. Randomly
                generated key-value pairs are stored and retrieved in a single transaction from PARTITIONED
                cache with TRANSACTIONAL atomicity mode.
            </p>

            <p><b>Results Summary</b></p>

            <p>
                Following results show that approximately 34,000 transactional cache put and get
                operations per second can be performed together in Ignite, as compared to only
                22,000 transactional put and get operations per second in Hazelcast.
