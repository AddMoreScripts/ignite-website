            <p>
                Both, Apache Ignite and Coherence provide a feature rich data grid functionality responsible for
                partitioning and caching data in memory with the capability to scale out across distributed clusters.
                However, by switching from Coherence to Apache Ignite, developers can leverage all the additional features
                that Ignite provides as compared to Coherence.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="comparison">

                    <td><p>
                        One of the disadvantages of proprietary software like Coherence, apart from the licensing fee,
                        is that there is little or no option to customize the software according to your needs.
                        Whereas Apache Ignite, being open source, gives developers the flexibility to tailor the software according
                        to their project’s requirements, using the source code and its pluggable APIs.

                    <td class="left">JCache (JSR107)</td>
                    <td><p>
                        Both, Apache Ignite and Coherence implement JCache specification (JSR 107), so it should be
                        a relatively easy process to switch from Coherence to Apache Ignite and take benefit of
                        the additional functionality available in Ignite.
                    </p></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="left">On-Heap vs. Off-Heap</td>
                    <td><p>
                        While <em>on-heap</em> memory is certainly the most natural way to cache data,
                        JVM does not work well with large heap sizes (more than 16GB), causing lengthy GC pauses.
                        Oracle Coherence does provide developers with a limited option to store the data <em>off-heap</em>,
                        however indexes still remain <em>on-heap</em>. Given that indexes usually require about 30% of additional space,
                        this can still lead to large GC pauses, which defeats the very reason to store the data <em>off-heap</em>
                        to begin with. Apache Ignite, on the other hand, is able to store both, the cached data and the indexes
                        in the <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/off-heap-memory"><em>off-heap</em></a> memory,
                        allowing to completely eliminate any GC overhead within user applications.

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="left">Standard SQL and JOIN Queries</td>
                    <td><p>
                        Oracle Coherence supports querying data from caches,
                        but does not support JOIN queries or standard SQL syntax. Apache Ignite, on the other hand,
                        supports free-form <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/cache-queries">SQL queries</a> virtually without any limitations (ANSI 99 compliant). You can use any
                        SQL function, any aggregation, any grouping and Ignite will figure out where to fetch the results from.
                        Ignite also supports distributed <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/cache-queries#section-sql-joins">SQL JOINs</a>. Moreover, if the data resides in different caches,
                        Ignite allows for cross-cache JOIN queries as well.

                    <td><p>
                        Coherence does not recommend using transactions due to its poor performance.
                        Apache Ignite <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/transactions">transactions</a>, on the other hand, provide excellent performance with 10s of thousands transactions/sec per server.

                        Apache Ignite provides <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/off-heap-memory#tiered-off-heap-storage">tiered storage</a> model, a feature not supported in Coherence,
                        where data can be stored and moved between <em>on-heap</em>, <em>off-heap</em>, and <em>swap</em> space. Going up the tier
                        provides more data storage capacity, with gradual increase in latency.

                        Coherence does not possess real-time data processing capabilities.
                        Apache Ignite <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/streaming--cep">streaming</a> allows to process continuous never-ending streams of data in scalable and fault-tolerant fashion.
                        Ignite streaming functionality also allows you to perform concurrent SQL queries on the streamed data.

                        Coherence uses a proprietary XML format for configuration and does not
                        really have any support for configuring a system directly from code. Apache Ignite supports standard
                        Java beans for configuration and natively integrates with Spring XML, as well as provides ability to
                        easily configure the system directly from code.
