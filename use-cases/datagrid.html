                <p>
                    Apache Ignite provides an extensive set of user-friendly APIs to serve as an in-memory data grid
                    that integrates into your existing architecture seamlessly and accelerates databases, services, and
                    custom APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An in-memory data grid type of deployment is also known as a read-through/write-through caching
                    strategy, in which case the application layer starts treating the data grid as the primary store.
                    While the application layer writes to and reads from Ignite, the latter ensures that any underlying
                    database stays updated and consistent with in-memory data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an in-memory data grid, Ignite provides all essential APIs needed to simplify its adoption.
                    The APIs include distributed key-value and ANSI SQL queries, ACID transactions, co-located
                    computations, and machine learning models. While key-value and SQL calls let you request, join, and
                    group distributed data sets, the compute and machine learning components help to eliminate data
                    shuffling over the network, thus, boosting compute and data-intensive calculations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ignite is capable of storing data both in memory and on disk with two options for data persistence
                    -- you can persist changes in an external database or let Ignite keep data in its native persistence.
                    Let's review both of these options.
                </p>

                <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-xs-12" style="padding-left:0; padding-right:0">
                    <div class="page-heading">Ignite and External Databases</div>
                    <p>
                        Ignite can improve the performance and scalability of any external database such as RDBMS,
                        NoSQL or Hadoop, by sliding in as an in-memory cache between the application and the database
                        layer. When an application writes data to the cache, Ignite automatically writes-through or
                        writes-behind all data modifications to the underlying external store. Ignite also performs
                        ACID transactions where it coordinates and commits a transaction across the cluster as well as
                        the database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, Ignite can be deployed as a shared and unified in-memory layer that stores data
                        sets originating from disjointed databases. Your applications can consume all the data from
                        Ignite as a single store while Ignite can keep the original databases in sync whenever in-memory
                        data gets updated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there are some limitations if an external database is used as a persistence layer for
                        Ignite deployments. For instance, if you run Ignite SQL or scan queries, you need to ensure that
                        all the data has been preloaded to the in-memory cluster. Note that Ignite SQL or scan queries
                        can read data from disk only if it is stored in Ignite native persistence.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-xs-12" style="padding-right:0">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/IMDG.png" width="300px" style="float:right;"/>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-xs-12" style="padding:0 0 20px 0;">
                <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-xs-12" style="padding-left:0; padding-right:0">
                    <div class="page-heading">Ignite Native Persistence</div>
                    <p>
                        Ignite native persistence is a distributed ACID and SQL-compliant disk store that transparently
                        integrates with Ignite in-memory layer. When the native persistence is enabled, Ignite stores both
                        data and indexes on disk and eliminates the time-consuming cache warm-up step. Since the
                        native persistence always keeps a full copy of data on disk, you are free to cache a subset of
                        records in memory. If a required data record is missing in memory, then Ignite reads it from the
                        disk automatically regardless of the API you use -- be it SQL, key-value, or scan queries.
