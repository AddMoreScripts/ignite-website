                        Apache Ignite can be used as all-in-one distributed database that supports SQL, key-value,
                        compute, machine learning and other data processing APIs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regardless of the API you decide to use, the data is always stored in a form of key-value pairs
                        across the cluster. The underlying key-value store distributes the data evenly guaranteeing that
                        every cluster node will own a portion of the overall data set.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The data and indexes can be stored both in RAM and, optionally, on disk if
                        <a href="/arch/persistence.html">Ignite Native Persistence</a> is enabled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ignite Persistent Store is a distributed ACID and SQL-compliant disk store that transparently
                        integrates with Ignite's durable memory as an optional disk layer storing data and indexes on
                        SSD, Flash, 3D XPoint, and other types of non-volatile storages.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-5 col-xs-12" style="padding-right:0">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/sql_database.png" width="400px" style="float:right;"/>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="page-heading">SQL</div>
            <p>
                Ignite complies with SQL ANSI-99 standard supporting all <b>SQL</b> and <b>DML</b> commands,
                including SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, MERGE, DELETE statements and distributed joins. It also provides
                support for a subset of <b>DDL</b> commands relevant for distributed SQL databases.
            </p>

            <div class="page-heading">Key-value</div>
            <p>
                Apache Ignite key-value APIs are compliant with <a href="/use-cases/caching/jcache-provider.html">
                JCache (JSR 107)</a> specification and provide extended features built on top such as
                distributed ACID transactions, scan and continuous queries, collocated processing.
            </p>
            <div class="page-heading">Collocated Processing</div>
            <p>
                The disk-centric systems, like RDBMS or NoSQL, generally utilize the classic client-server
                approach, where the data is brought from the server to the client side where it gets processed
                and then is usually discarded. This approach does not scale well as moving the data over the
                network is the most expensive operation in a distributed system.
            </p>
            <p>
                A much more scalable approach is <a href="/features/collocatedprocessing.html">
                collocated processing</a> that reverses the flow by bringing the computations to the servers where
                the data actually resides. This approach allows you to execute advanced logic or distributed SQL
                with JOINs exactly where the data is stored avoiding expensive serialization and network trips.
            </p>
            <div class="page-heading">Partitioning & Replication</div>
            <p>
                Depending on the configuration, Ignite can either partition or replicate data.
                Unlike <code>REPLICATED</code> mode, where data is fully replicated across all nodes
                in the cluster, in <code>PARTITIONED</code> mode Ignite will equally split the data across
                multiple cluster nodes, allowing for staring TBs of data both in memory and on disk.
            </p>
            <div class="page-heading">Redundancy</div>
            <p>
                Ignite also allows to configure multiple <b>backup copies</b> to guarantee data resiliency
                in case of failures.
            </p>
            <div class="page-heading">Consistency</div>
            <p>
                Regardless of which replication scheme is used, Ignite guarantees data consistency across
                all cluster members.
