                        Apache Ignite is a distributed memory-centric database and caching platform that is used by
                        Apache Spark users to:

                                Achieve true in-memory performance and avoid data movement from a data source to
                                Spark workers and applications.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Share the state among several running Spark applications.

            <p>
                Apache Ignite provides an implementation of Spark RDD abstraction which allows to
                easily share state in memory across Spark jobs. The main difference between native
                Spark RDD and IgniteRDD is that Ignite RDD provides a shared in-memory view on data across
                different Spark jobs, workers, or applications, while other Spark jobs or applications
                cannot see native Spark RDD.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also, even Apache Spark supports a fairly rich SQL syntax, it doesn’t support indexing natively.
                Spark queries may take minutes, even on moderately small data sets by doing full scans of data.
                With Ignite, Spark users can configure primary and secondary indexes that can bring 1000x
                performance improvement depending on a use case.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way IgniteRDD is implemented is as a view over a distributed Ignite table (aka. cache),
                which may be deployed either within the Spark job executing process, or on a Spark worker,
                or in its cluster. It means that depending on the chosen deployment mode the shared state may
                either exist only during the lifespan of a Spark applicati​on (embedded mode), or it may
                out-survive the Spark application (standalone mode) in which case the state can be shared
                across multiple Spark applications.
            </p>

            <div class="page-heading">Ignite DataFrames</div>
            <p>
                Apache Spark DataFrame API introduced the concept of a schema to describe the data,
                allowing Spark to manage the schema and organize the data into a tabular format.
                To put it simply, a DataFrame is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns.
                It is conceptually equivalent to a table in a relational database which allows Spark leveraging
                from Catalyst query optimizer. The optimizer produces much more efficient query execution plans
                in compare to RDDs which are just collections of elements partitioned across the nodes of the cluster.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ignite DataFrame implementation expands and makes standard DataFrames much more performant whenever
                Ignite is used as memory-centric storage for Spark. That gives following benefits:
                <ul class="page-list" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <li>
                    Ability to share DataFrames across Spark workers by writing and reading DataFrames to/from Ignite.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Faster Spark SQL queries with an in-place execution of Spark's query execution plans in Ignite
                    which avoids data movement from Ignite to Spark.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Boost Spark SQL even further by defining primary and secondary indexes on Ignite side.
                </li>
                </ul>
