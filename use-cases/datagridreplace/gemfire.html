            <p>
                Both, Apache Ignite and GemFire provide a feature rich data grid functionality responsible for
                partitioning and caching data in memory with the capability to scale out across distributed clusters.
                However, by switching from GemFire to Apache Ignite, developers can leverage all the additional
                features that Ignite provides as compared to GemFire.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="comparison">
            <table class="formatted">
                <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th width="35%" class="left">Feature</th>

                    <td class="left">Open Source vs. Closed Source</td>
                    <td><p>
                        One of the disadvantages of proprietary software like GemFire, apart from the licensing fee,
                        is that there is little or no option to customize the software according to your needs.
                        Whereas Apache Ignite, being open source, gives developers the flexibility to tailor the software according
                        to their project’s requirements, using the source code and its pluggable APIs.
                    </p></td>

                <tr>
                    <td class="left">JCache (JSR107)</td>
                    <td><p>
                        GemFire does not implement JCache and uses outdated proprietary APIs. Apache Ignite data grid is an implementation of
                        <span style="white-space: nowrap"><a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/jcache">JCache</a> (JSR 107)</span> specification. JCache provides a very simple to use, but yet very powerful API for data access.
                    </p></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="left">On-Heap vs. Off-Heap</td>
                    <td><p>
                        While <em>on-heap</em> memory is certainly the most natural way to cache data,
                        JVM does not work well with large heap sizes (more than 16GB), causing lengthy GC pauses.
                        The most common solution to overcome lengthy GC is to store data in the off-heap memory, which is not supported in GemFire.
                        Apache Ignite, on the other hand, is able to store both, the cached data and the indexes
                        in the <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/off-heap-memory"><em>off-heap</em></a> memory,
                        allowing to completely eliminate any GC overhead within user applications.
                    </p></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="left">Standard SQL and JOIN Queries</td>
                    <td><p>
                        GemFire supports querying data from cache but requires developers to familiarize themselves with OQL,
                        since it does not support the standard SQL syntax.  Apache Ignite, on the other hand,
                        supports free-form <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/cache-queries">SQL queries</a>
                        virtually without any limitations (ANSI 99 compliant). You can use any
                        SQL function, any aggregation, any grouping and Ignite will figure out where to fetch the results from.
                        Ignite also supports distributed <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/cache-queries#section-sql-joins">SQL JOINs</a>.
                        Moreover, if the data resides in different caches, Ignite allows for cross-cache JOIN queries as well.

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="left">Cross-Partition Transactions</td>
                    <td><p>
                        GemFire does not support transactions across different cache partitions or nodes.
                        Support for cross-partition transactions is one of the salient features of Apache Ignite
                        where <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/transactions">transactions</a> can be performed on all partitions of a cache across the whole cluster.

                    <td class="left">Tiered Storage</td>
                    <td><p>
                        Apache Ignite provides <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/off-heap-memory#tiered-off-heap-storage">tiered storage</a> model, a feature not supported in GemFire,
                        where data can be stored and moved between <em>on-heap</em>, <em>off-heap</em>, and <em>swap</em> space. Going up the tier
                        provides more data storage capacity, with gradual increase in latency.
                    </p></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="left">Data Streaming</td>
                    <td><p>
                        GemFire does not possess real-time data processing capabilities.
                        Apache Ignite <a href="http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/streaming--cep">streaming</a> allows to process continuous never-ending streams of data in scalable and fault-tolerant fashion.
                        Ignite streaming functionality also allows you to perform concurrent SQL queries on the streamed data.
                    </p></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="left">Configuration and Deployment</td>
                    <td><p>
                        GemFire uses a proprietary XML format for configuration and does not
                        really have any support for configuring a system directly from code. Apache Ignite supports standard
                        Java beans for configuration and natively integrates with Spring XML, as well as provides ability to
                        easily configure the system directly from code.
