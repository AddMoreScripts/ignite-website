            <h2 class="first">Ignite for Database Caching</h2>
            <p>
                In a traditional multi-tier application, where data is kept independent of application tier or business logic,
                frequent application calls to persistence layer can cause substancial latency problems.
                This can be mittigated by storing data close to the application tier via database caching.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apache Ignite database caching enables users to keep the most frequently used data in memory- partitioned or
                replicated across a cluster of computers and closer to the processing application. This provides greatly improved
                performance than fetching data from external data sources on each request, as frequent operations can be
                performed in memory and in a parallel fashion.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ignite cluster can be scaled horizontally, to hundreds of nodes, on demand.
                Each new node joining the Ignite cluster can auto-discover other cluster nodes and, at this point,
                data is rebalanced to maintain even distribution of keys across all nodes.
                In the event of a node crash, Ignite cluster can self-heal, wherein data from the failed node
                is propagated to other nodes in the grid. Ignite guarantees that as long as there is at least one node standing,
                no data will ever be lost.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to being highly elastic and resilient, Ignite In-memory Data Fabric is lightening fast and a fully
                compliant implementation of JCache (JSR 107) specification. Ignite is also fully compliant with other caching technologies, likes of which include - Memcached, Spring and Hibernate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apache Ignite offers a wide range of functionalities that can be used to process cached data. These include:
                <ul class="page-list">
                    <li>Distributed In-Memory ACID Transactions</li>
                    <li>Tiered Off-Heap Storage</li>
                    <li>Distributed ANSI-99 SQL Queries with support for Joins</li>
                    <li>JDBC Driver</li>
                    <li>Distributed Computations</li>
                    <li>Continuous Queries</li>
                    <li>Distributed Data Structures</li>
                    <li>Support for various underlying data store types - RDBMS, NoSQL and Hadoop</li>
                </ul>
