                        Distributed in-memory cache that supports ANSI SQL, ACID transactions and co-located
                        computations is one of the usage scenarios Apache Ignite is selected for. From web sessions
                        and financial instruments caching to external APIs and existing databases acceleration, Ignite
                        provides all essential components needed to speed up enterprise applications as well as
                        microservices-based architectures that require more than standard key-value look-ups for data
                        processing.

            </div>

            <p>
                As a typical distributed cache, you would span Ignite cluster across several interconnected
                physical or virtual machines letting it utilize all the available memory and CPU resources.
                However, the difference comes in a way you can utilize the cluster once it's up and running. In
                addition to classic key-value APIs you can run distributed SQL queries joining and grouping
                various data sets. If strong consistency is required, you can execute multi-records and
                cross-cache ACID transactions in both pessimistic and optimistic modes. Next, if an
                application runs compute or data-intensive logic, you can minimize data shuffling and network
                utilization by running co-located computations and distributed machine learning APIs on the cluster
                nodes that store actual data.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are two primary deployment strategies for Ignite as an in-memory cache -- the cache-aside one and
                read-through/write-through caching. Let's review both separately.
            </p>

            <div class="page-heading">Cache-Aside Deployment</div>
            <p>
                With the cache-aside deployment strategy, the cache is deployed separately from a primary data store
                and might not even know about existence of the latter. An application layer becomes in charge of
                synchronization between a cache and a primary data store. If a record gets updated in the data store
                then either the application or some change-data-capture (CDC) process needs to refresh a similar
                record in the cache.
            </p>
            <p>
                This strategy works well when the cached data is rather static and not updated frequently or
                temporary data lag/inconsistency is allowed between the primary store and the in-memory cache. It's
                assumed that the cache and the store will become consistent eventually as soon as soon as changes are
                replicated in full.
            </p>
            <p>
                If Apache Ignite is deployed in this configuration, then its native persistence can be used as a disk
                store. This lets eliminate time-consuming data reloading phase from the primary store as well as
                a cache warm-up step. Furthermore, the native persistence allows you to cache a subset of the data
                by keeping the full copy on disk. If any piece of data is not cached in RAM then Ignite will take
                it from disk automatically regardless of the API you use let it be SQL, key-value or scan queries.
            </p>

            <div class="page-heading">Read-Through/Write-Through Caching</div>
            <p>
                The read-through/write-through caching strategy can also be classified as an in-memory data grid type
                of deployment. When Apache Ignite is deployed as a data grid, the application layer starts
                treating an Ignite cluster as the primary store. The applications write to and read from Ignite only
                and it becomes Ignite's responsobility to keep an underlying external database updated and
                consistent with the in-memory data.
            </p>

            <p>
                This strategy is favorable for architectures that need to accelerate performance or scale external
                disk-based databases such as RDBMS or NoSQL. Ignite integrates with many databases out-of-the box and
                can write-through or write-behind all the changes to them. This also includes ACID transactions -
                Ignite will coordinate and commit a transaction across its own in-memory cluster as well as to a
                relational database.
            </p>
            <p>
                The read-through capability assumes that a cache can read data from the external database if a record
                is missing in memory. Ignite fully supports this capability for key-value APIs. However, if Ignite
                SQL is at use then you have to preload an entire data set from the underlying database first. (Note,
                that Ignite SQL can query disk if data is persisted in its own native persistence).
