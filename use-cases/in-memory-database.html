            <div class="page-heading">Memory-Centric Architecture</div>
            <p>
                Apache Ignite memory management system is memory-centric in the sense that most of the processing takes
                place in-memory on cached data with a superset of data persisted to disk. Such an architecture lets
                combine advantages of in-memory computing with the disk durability and strong consistency in one system.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the native persistence is enabled, Ignite allows you to control how much memory space is to be
                consumed by Ignite. Depending on the memory space available, Ignite either caches a full data set in
                memory, thus, performing as fast as it can or keeps only the most frequently data there, pulling
                missing records from disk. For instance, if there are 100 records and your memory capacity allows to
                cache only 20 of them, then all 100 will be stored on disk, and only 20 will be cached in memory for
                better performance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, these are the primary advantages of Ignite memory-centric architecture:
            </p>
            <ul class="page-list" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <li>
                    Flexible configuration of available memory and disk resources as long as Ignite allows storing a
                    superset of data on disk and only the most frequently used subsets in memory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ignite SQL queries and all other APIs can query both cached data sets as well as other data that
                    is kept on disk only.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Instantaneous cluster restarts. Ignite becomes fully operational from disk immediately upon cluster
                    startup or restarts. There is no need to preload or warm up the in-memory caches.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="page-heading">Better High-Availability With Instantaneous Cluster Restarts</div>

            <p>
                If you enable Ignite native persistence for your deployments, then there is no need to worry about
                time-consuming memory warm-ups on cluster restarts. As long as Ignite persistence always keeps a
                superset of data on disk and treats it as one of the storage layers, Ignite starts reading data from
                the persistence as soon as the cluster becomes active. The memory tier is warmed up in the background
                with the data Ignite accesses on disk for you.
            </p>

            <div class="page-heading">Avoiding Network Impact on Performance With Co-located Processing</div>

            <p>
                The disk-centric systems, like RDBMS or NoSQL, generally utilize the classic client-server approach,
                when the data is transferred from the server to the client-side where it gets processed and then usually
                discarded. This approach does not scale well as moving the data over the network is the most expensive
                operation in a distributed system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many distributed databases, including Apache Ignite, support another more scalable approach called
                co-located processing that eliminates or reduces network traffic significantly by running application
                logic right on the cluster nodes. This approach executes data or compute-intensive logic, including
                distributed SQL with JOINs, exactly where the data resides, thus, reducing data shuffling over the network.
            </p>
