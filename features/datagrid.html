                <p>
                    Apache Ignite provides an extensive set of APIs to act as an in-memory data grid that integrates into
                    your existing architecture and accelerates databases, services, or custom APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An in-memory data grid type of deployment is also known as a read-through/write-through caching
                    strategy. With this strategy, Ignite plugs into your existing architecture seamlessly, and the
                    application layer starts treating it as a primary store. Your application layer writes to and reads
                    from Ignite, while the latter ensures that any underlying external databases stay updated and
                    consistent with in-memory data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an in-memory data grid, Ignite provides all the essential developer APIs needed to simplify its
                    adoption. The APIs include distributed key-value and ANSI SQL queries, ACID transactions,
                    co-located computations, and machine learning models. While key-value and SQL calls let you request,
                    join, and group distributed data sets, the compute and machine learning components help to eliminate
                    data shuffling over the network, thus, boosting compute and data-intensive calculations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ignite is capable of storing data both in memory and on disk with two options for data persistence
                    -- you can persist changes in an external database or let Ignite keep data in its native persistence.
                    Let's review two of them.
                </p>

                <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-xs-12" style="padding-left:0; padding-right:0">
                    <div class="page-heading">Ignite and External Databases</div>
                    <p>
                        Ignite as an in-memory data grid can improve performance and scalability of existing external
                        databases such as RDBMS, NoSQL or Hadoop, by sliding in as an in-memory cache between the application
                        and database layers. Ignite will automatically write-through or write-behind all the changes to
                        an external store. It also includes ACID transactions - Ignite coordinates and commits a
                        transaction across its in-memory cluster as well as a relational database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to that, Ignite can be deployed as a shared and unified in-memory layer that stores
                        data sets originating from disjointed databases. Your applications can consume all the data from
                        Ignite as a single store while Ignite can keep the original databases in sync whenever in-memory
                        data gets updated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there are some limitations if an external database is used as a persistence layer for
                        Ignite deployments. For instance, if you run Ignite SQL or scan queries, you need to ensure
                        that all the data has already been preloaded to the in-memory cluster. Note that Ignite SQL or
                        scan queries can read data from disk only if it's stored in Ignite native persistence.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-xs-12" style="padding-right:0">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/IMDG.png" width="300px" style="float:right;"/>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-xs-12" style="padding:0 0 20px 0;">
                <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-xs-12" style="padding-left:0; padding-right:0">
                    <div class="page-heading">Ignite Native Persistence</div>
                    <p>
                        Ignite native persistence is a distributed ACID and SQL-compliant disk store that transparently
                        integrates with Ignite in-memory layer. When native persistence is enabled, Ignite stores
                        both data and indexes on disk.
                        The native persistence lets eliminate time-consuming data reloading
                        phase from external databases as well as a cache warm-up step. Furthermore, since the native
                        persistence always keeps a full copy of data on disk, you are free to cache a subset of
                        records in memory. If Ignite finds that a record is missing in memory, then it will read it from
                        disk automatically regardless of the API you use -- let it be SQL, key-value, or scan queries.
                    </p>
                </div>
