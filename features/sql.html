                        Apache Ignite comes with ANSI-99 compliant, horizontally scalable, and fault-tolerant SQL engine.
                        That allows you to interact with Ignite as with a regular SQL database using JDBC, ODBC drivers,
                        or native SQL APIs available for Java, C#, C++, Python, and other programming languages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ignite supports all DML commands, including SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE
                        queries as well as a subset of DDL commands relevant for distributed systems.
                    </p>

            <div class="page-heading">SQL Joins</div>
            <p>
                Ignite fully supports distributed joins for advanced querying needs. A distributed join is a SQL statement
                with a join clause that combines two or more tables. If the tables are joined on the partitioning column
                (affinity or primary key), the join is called a co-located join. Otherwise, if the tables were not
                co-located initially, then Ignite does the join in a non-colocated fashion. The co-located joins avoid
                data shuffling between nodes, minimizes network usage, thus, performing much faster than a non
                co-located counterpart.
            </p>

            <div class="page-heading">SQL and In-Memory Mode</div>
            <p>
                Apache Ignite can function in a pure in-memory mode when all data and indexes are located solely in memory.
                In this mode, Ignite SQL shows the highest performance as long as all the data is served from memory,
                and there is no need to update the disk tier.
            </p>

            <div class="page-heading">SQL and Native Persistence</div>
            <p>
                In this mode, Ignite persists 100% of data and indexes in the native persistence while caching as much
                as possible in memory. Ignite SQL engine does not require to cache an entire data set in memory to
                operate correctly. If the engine finds that any record is not cached, then it will be taken from disk.
                Your application merely executes SQL queries, and Ignite gets the records from both memory and disk
                automatically.
            </p>
            <p>
                On cluster restarts, Ignite reads data and indexes from disk, eliminating the need for memory warm-up.
                That significantly decreases the time of any potential downtimes.

            </p>

            <div class="page-heading">SQL and 3rd Party Databases</div>
            <p>
                Ignite can be used as a caching layer for external databases such as RDBMS, NoSQL, or Hadoop.
                In this mode, the Ignite SQL engine requires to cache all the data needed for SQL queries in memory as
                long as the engine does not support federated queries at the moment.
            </p>

            <p>
                If federate queries between Ignite and an external database are required, then you can consider Ignite
                integration for Spark -- DataFrames API can join data stored in Ignite and other systems.
            </p>
