                    <p>Apache Ignite Machine Learning (ML) is a set of simple, scalable and efficient tools that allow
                        building predictive machine learning models without costly data transfers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rationale for adding machine and deep learning (DL) to Apache Ignite is quite simple.
                        Today's data scientists have to deal with two major factors that keep ML from mainstream adoption.

                    </p>
                    <div class="page-heading">Problem #1: Constant Data Movement (ETL)</div>

                    <p>
                        First, the models are trained and deployed (after the training is over) in different systems.
                        The data scientists have to wait for ETL or some other data transfer process to move the data
                        into a system like Apache Mahout or Apache Spark for a training purpose. Then they have to wait
                        while this process completes and redeploy the models in a production environment. The whole
                        process can take hours moving terabytes of data from one system to another. Moreover, the
                        training part usually happens over the old data set.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-5 col-xs-12" style="padding-right:0; top: -10px;">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/machine_learning.png" width="440px" style="float:right;"/>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="page-heading">Problem #2: Lack of Horizontal Scalability</div>

            <p>
                The second factor is related to scalability. ML and DL algorithms that have to
                process data sets which no longer fit within a single server unit are constantly growing.
                This urges the data scientist to come up with sophisticated solutions o​r turn to distributed
                computing platforms such as Apache Spark and TensorFlow. However, those platforms mostly solve
                only a part of the puzzle which is the models training, making it a burden of the developers to
                decide how do deploy the models in production later.
            </p>

            <div class="page-heading">Zero ETL and Massive Scalability</div>

            <p>
                Ignite Machine Learning relies on Ignite's memory-centric storage that brings massive scalability
                for ML and DL tasks and eliminates the wait imposed by ETL between the different systems.
                For instance, it allows users to run ML/DL training and inference directly on data stored across
                memory and disk in an Ignite cluster. Next, Ignite provides a host
                of ML and DL algorithms that are optimized for Ignite's collocated distributed processing.
                These implementations deliver in-memory speed and unlimited horizontal scalability when running
                in place against massive data sets or incrementally against incoming data streams, without
                requiring the data to be moved into another store. By eliminating the data movement and the
                long processing wait times, Ignite Machine learning enables continuous learning that can
                improve decisions based on the latest data as it arrives in real-time.
            </p>

            <div class="page-heading">Fault Tolerance and Continuous Learning</div>
            <p>
                Apache Ignite Machine Learning is tolerant to node failures. This means that in the case of node
                failures during the learning process, all recovery procedures will be transparent to the user,
                learning processes won't be interrupted, and we will get results in the time similar to the case when
                all nodes work fine.

                    <p>Machine learning component goes with a set of genetic algorithms (GA) which is a method of
                        solving optimization problems by simulating the process of biological evolution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        GAs are excellent for searching through large and complex data sets for an optimal solution.
                        Real world applications of GAs include:  automotive design, computer gaming, robotics, investments,
                        traffic/shipment routing and more.
